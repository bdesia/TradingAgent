### DDQN Trading Agent

**Overview**

This project implements a Double Deep Q-Learning (DDQN) agent for stock trading, developed for the AI Specialization at FIUBA (2025). It uses historical AAPL stock data (2015â€“2025) to train an agent to make buy, sell, or hold decisions in a custom Gymnasium environment, incorporating transaction costs and technical indicators (EMA, RSI). The goal is to maximize portfolio value in a simulated market.
